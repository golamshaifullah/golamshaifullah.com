Current position
----------------

*Post-doctoral Researcher*, ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio
Astronomy.  
Supervisor: Dr. Gemma <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Janssen</span>  
Start date: 15/05/2017  
My post-doctoral research is mainly linked to the study of the effects
of the inter-stellar medium on the radio-frequency signals of pulsars.
Much of my work is carried out within the framework of pulsar timing
arrays, which are experiments that use a large number of pulsars spread
across the Milky Way Galaxy to detect very low frequency gravitational
waves. I spend the majority of my time studying the deleterious effects
of the inter-stellar medium on pulsar signals and improving existing
methods of modelling these effects to increase the possibility of
detecting gravitational waves.

Besides this, I also study the properties of pulsars across a wide range
of radio frequencies, using some of the largest radio telescopes in the
world such as the 300-m dish of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the
Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope,
the Parkes 64-m radio telescope and the LOFAR radio telescope. I am also
involved in pulsar observations with the exciting, new NenuFAR low
frequency telescope and the MeerKAT array in South Africa.

I am an active member of the European Pulsar Timing Array collaboration,
and the International Pulsar Timing Array collaboration.

Research Experience
-------------------

**Timing and Properties of Recycled Pulsars**  
The primary focus of my Ph.D. thesis was on understanding the long term
(on the order of decades) timing properties of black-widow pulsars. The
thesis also consisted of a project on detection and removal of artifacts
due to sideband leakage in pulsar astronomy back-ends. A final component
of the thesis involved the measurement of the spectral indices of
millisecond pulsars using ultra-wideband observations.  

**Initiating Design and Development of RF related Front-End Electronics
and Data Acquisition System**  
My responsibilities involved the design and development of compact
antennas for radio astronomy, and the intermediate signal conditioning
circuit to feed an FPGA based ‘baseband’ receiver. I developed the
electric and magnetic field antennas, as well as, different
amplification stages for conditioning the input signal for feeding the
ADC prior to the receiver.  

**Construction of a two element radio-interferometer**  
I was also a co-investigator in a project to construct a two dish
interferometer, to be used primarily for the purpose of training
undergraduate and graduate students in observational radio-astronomy, at
the Department of Electronic Science, University of Pune.
