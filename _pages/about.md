I am a radio astronomer, and I study Neutron Stars; the rapidly rotating, collapsed remains of a Supernova.

Most of my doctoral and post-doctoral research revolves around using pulsars as fundamental physics probes. The majority of this involves working with pulsar timing arrays (often referred to by the abbreviation PTAs), which are Milky Way scale detectors of nanohertz Gravitational Waves emitted during the slow inspiral and merger of super-massive blackhole binaries.

As with any other detector (and real life experiments) the greatest challenge to detecting these signals lies in understanding the sources of noise. For PTAs, these sources can be grouped into noise intrinsic to the pulsars used in the array, noise due to variations of the interstellar medium and the Solar Wind, noise due to errors in the location of the Solar System Barycentre and finally, noise due to variations in the observing systems and telescopes used to observe the pulsars.

Detecting and characterising each of these noise sources forms the vast majorioty of my day to day to work. However, much of my recent work revolves around trying to characterise the interstellar medium and the effects of errors in Solar Wind models.
