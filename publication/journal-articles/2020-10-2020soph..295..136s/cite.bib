	abstract = {We present a python-based tool to detect the occultation of back-ground sources by foreground solar coronal mass ejections. The tool takes as input standard celestial coordinates of the source and translates those to the helioprojective plane, and is thus well suited for use with a wide variety of background astronomical sources. This tool provides an easy means to search through a large archival dataset for such crossings and relies on the well-tested AstroPy and SunPy modules.},
