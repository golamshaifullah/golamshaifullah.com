	abstract = {We report on the high-precision timing of 42 radio millisecond pulsars &lpar;MSPs&rpar; observed by the European Pulsar Timing Array &lpar;EPTA&rpar;. This EPTA Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7-18 yr. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with TEMPONEST yields the detection of several new parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semimajor axis. We find the NE2001 Galactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances &lpar;after correction from the Lutz-Kelker bias&rpar; than the M2 and M3 models by Schnitzeler. However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80 per cent &lpar;fractional&rpar; for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19 isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these two populations. We detect Shapiro delay in the timing residuals of PSRs J1600-3053 and J1918-0642, implying pulsar and companion masses m_p=1.22_&lcub;-0.35&rcub;&Hat;&lcub;+0.5&rcub; M_&lcub;&#8857;&rcub;, m_c = 0.21_&lcub;-0.04&rcub;&Hat;&lcub;+0.06&rcub; M_&lcub;&#8857;&rcub; and m_p=1.25_&lcub;-0.4&rcub;&Hat;&lcub;+0.6&rcub; M_&lcub;&#8857;&rcub;, m_c = 0.23_&lcub;-0.05&rcub;&Hat;&lcub;+0.07&rcub; M_&lcub;&#8857;&rcub;, respectively. Finally, we use the measurement of the orbital period derivative to set a stringent constraint on the distance to PSRs J1012+5307 and J1909-3744, and set limits on the longitude of ascending node through the search of the annual-orbital parallax for PSRs J1600-3053 and J1909-3744.},
