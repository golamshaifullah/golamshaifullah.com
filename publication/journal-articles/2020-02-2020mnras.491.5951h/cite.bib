	abstract = {We have constructed a new time-scale, TT&lpar;IPTA16&rpar;, based on observations of radio pulsars presented in the first data release from the International Pulsar Timing Array &lpar;IPTA&rpar;. We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise models for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar time-scale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT&lpar;BIPM17&rpar;, a post-corrected time-scale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures &lpar;BIPM&rpar;. We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT&lpar;BIPM17&rpar; if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT&lpar;BIPM17&rpar; is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT&lpar;IPTA16&rpar; with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based time-scales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best time-scales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic time-scales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based time-scale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT&lpar;BIPM17&rpar; will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.},
