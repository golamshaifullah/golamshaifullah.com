	abstract = {PSR J0922+0638 &lpar;B0919+06&rpar; shows unexplained anomalous variations in the on-pulse phase, where the pulse appears to episodically move to an earlier longitude for a few tens of rotations before reverting to the usual phase for approximately several hundred to more than a thousand rotations. These events, where the pulse moves in phase by up to 5&#176;, have been previously detected in observations from &amp;sim;300 to 2000 MHz. We present simultaneous observations from the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at 1350 MHz and the Bornim &lpar;Potsdam&rpar; station of the LOw Frequency ARray at 150 MHz. Our observations present the first evidence for an absence of the anomalous phase-shifting behaviour at 150 MHz. Instead, the observed intensity at the usual pulse-phase typically decreases, often showing a pseudo-nulling feature corresponding to the times when phase shifts are observed at 1350 MHz. The presence of weak emission at the usual pulse-phase supports the theory that these shifts may result from processes similar to the `profile-absorption&apos; expected to operate for PSR J0814+7429 &lpar;B0809+74&rpar;. A possible mechanism for this could be intrinsic variations of the emission within the pulsar&apos;s beam combined with absorption by expanding shells of electrons in the line of sight.},
