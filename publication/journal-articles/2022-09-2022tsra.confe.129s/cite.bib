	abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays &lpar;PTAs&rpar; are inching closer to the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background &lpar;GWB&rpar;, most likely produced through the inspiral of nearly circularised SMBHBs. In the coming months the European Pulsar Timing Array &lpar;EPTA&rpar; will be releasing its latest dataset, adding approximately ten years of high precision pulsar timing data to bring the total timespan up to almost 25 years. This new dataset contains almost twice the previous data volume, and is leading to significantly increased &lpar;pulsar timing&rpar; precision. A small part of this new dataset has already been used to place the EPTA&apos;s current limit on the amplitude of the stochastic GWB as well as showing the presence of a common but spatially uncorrelated red noise process, and the full dataset will be used to significantly improve the current results at both, lower and higher frequencies, as well as investigating a number of other PTA scientific objectives. I will present the current state of the dataset, our release plans and early science insights.},
