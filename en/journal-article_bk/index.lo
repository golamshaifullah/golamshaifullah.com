abstract: "The sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays to gravitational waves (GWs) depends on the noise present in the individual pulsar timing data. Noise may be either intrinsic or extrinsic to the pulsar. Intrinsic sources of noise will include rotational instabilities, for example. Extrinsic sources of noise include contributions from physical processes which are not sufficiently well modelled, for example, dispersion and scattering effects, analysis errors and instrumental instabilities. We present the results from a noise analysis for 42 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For characterizing the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or `timing noise', we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist statistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of their timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent results. For the remaining 17 MSPs, we place upper limits on the timing noise amplitude at the 95 per cent confidence level. We additionally place an upper limit on the contribution to the pulsar noise budget from errors in the reference terrestrial time standards (below 1 per cent), and we find evidence for a noise component which is present only in the data of one of the four used telescopes. Finally, we estimate that the timing noise of individual pulsars reduces the sensitivity of this data set to an isotropic, stochastic GW background by a factor of &gt;9.1 and by a factor of &gt;2.3 for continuous GWs from resolvable, inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries with circular orbits."

abstract: "The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of (astro)physical investigations. In particular, arrays of pulsars with rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such `pulsar timing arrays' (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past decades and collectively form the `International' PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs, I.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and inhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that complicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing efforts. The first IPTA data release presented here (and available online) is used to demonstrate the IPTA's potential of improving upon gravitational-wave limits placed by individual PTAs by a factor of ∼2 and provides a 2σ limit on the dimensionless amplitude of a stochastic gravitational-wave background of 1.7 × 10<SUP>-15</SUP> at a frequency of 1 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is 1.7 times less constraining than the limit placed by Shannon et al., due mostly to the more recent, high-quality data they used."

abstract: "We analyse the stochastic properties of the 49 pulsars that comprise the first International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) data release. We use Bayesian methodology, performing model selection to determine the optimal description of the stochastic signals present in each pulsar. In addition to spin-noise and dispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise unique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved radio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different observing systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and band-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643-1224 has, in addition to DM variations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs which we interpret as coming from time-variable scattering or refraction in the ionized interstellar medium. Failing to model these different contributions appropriately can dramatically alter the astrophysical interpretation of the stochastic signals observed in the residuals. In some cases, the spectral exponent of the spin-noise signal can vary from 1.6 to 4 depending upon the model, which has direct implications for the long-term sensitivity of the pulsar to a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. By using a more appropriate model, however, we can greatly improve a pulsar's sensitivity to GWs. For example, including system and band-dependent signals in the PSR J0437-4715 data set improves the upper limit on a fiducial GW background by ∼60 per cent compared to a model that includes DM variations and spin-noise only."

abstract: "We report on the high-precision timing of 42 radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). This EPTA Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7-18 yr. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with TEMPONEST yields the detection of several new parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semimajor axis. We find the NE2001 Galactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances (after correction from the Lutz-Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models by Schnitzeler. However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80 per cent (fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19 isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these two populations. We detect Shapiro delay in the timing residuals of PSRs J1600-3053 and J1918-0642, implying pulsar and companion masses m_p=1.22_{-0.35}^{+0.5} M_{⊙}, m_c = 0.21_{-0.04}^{+0.06} M_{⊙} and m_p=1.25_{-0.4}^{+0.6} M_{⊙}, m_c = 0.23_{-0.05}^{+0.07} M_{⊙}, respectively. Finally, we use the measurement of the orbital period derivative to set a stringent constraint on the distance to PSRs J1012+5307 and J1909-3744, and set limits on the longitude of ascending node through the search of the annual-orbital parallax for PSRs J1600-3053 and J1909-3744."

abstract: "We report on 22 yr of radio timing observations of the millisecond pulsar J1024-0719 by the telescopes participating in the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). These observations reveal a significant second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and confirm the discrepancy between the parallax and Shklovskii distances that has been reported earlier. We also present optical astrometry, photometry and spectroscopy of 2MASS J10243869-0719190. We find that it is a low-metallicity main-sequence star (K7V spectral type, [M/H] = -1.0, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 4050 ± 50 K) and that its position, proper motion and distance are consistent with those of PSR J1024-0719. We conclude that PSR J1024-0719 and 2MASS J10243869-0719190 form a common proper motion pair and are gravitationally bound. The gravitational interaction between the main-sequence star and the pulsar accounts for the spin frequency derivatives, which in turn resolves the distance discrepancy. Our observations suggest that the pulsar and main-sequence star are in an extremely wide (P<SUB>b</SUB> &gt; 200 yr) orbit. Combining the radial velocity of the companion and proper motion of the pulsar, we find that the binary system has a high spatial velocity of 384 ± 45 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with respect to the local standard of rest and has a Galactic orbit consistent with halo objects. Since the observed main-sequence companion star cannot have recycled the pulsar to millisecond spin periods, an exotic formation scenario is required. We demonstrate that this extremely wide-orbit binary could have evolved from a triple system that underwent an asymmetric supernova explosion, though find that significant fine-tuning during the explosion is required. Finally, we discuss the implications of the long period orbit on the timing stability of PSR J1024-0719 in light of its inclusion in pulsar timing arrays."

abstract: "We present evidence for a small glitch in the spin evolution of the millisecond pulsar J0613-0200, using the EPTA Data Release 1.0, combined with Jodrell Bank analogue filterbank times of arrival (TOAs) recorded with the Lovell telescope and Effelsberg Pulsar Observing System TOAs. A spin frequency step of 0.82(3) nHz and frequency derivative step of -1.6(39) × 10<SUP>-19</SUP> Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> are measured at the epoch of MJD 50888(30). After PSR B1821-24A, this is only the second glitch ever observed in a millisecond pulsar, with a fractional size in frequency of Δν/ν = 2.5(1) × 10<SUP>-12</SUP>, which is several times smaller than the previous smallest glitch. PSR J0613-0200 is used in gravitational wave searches with pulsar timing arrays, and is to date only the second such pulsar to have experienced a glitch in a combined 886 pulsar-years of observations. We find that accurately modelling the glitch does not impact the timing precision for pulsar timing array applications. We estimate that for the current set of millisecond pulsars included in the International Pulsar Timing Array, there is a probability of ∼50 per cent that another glitch will be observed in a timing array pulsar within 10 years."

abstract: "Timing results for the black-widow pulsar J2051-0827 are presented, using a 21 year data set from four European Pulsar Timing Array telescopes and the Parkes radio telescope. This data set, which is the longest published to date for a black-widow system, allows for an improved analysis that addresses previously unknown biases. While secular variations, as identified in previous analyses, are recovered, short-term variations are detected for the first time. Concurrently, a significant decrease of ∼ 2.5 × 10<SUP>- 3</SUP> cm<SUP>- 3</SUP> pc in the dispersion measure associated with PSR J2051-0827 is measured for the first time and improvements are also made to estimates of the proper motion.

abstract: "PSR J0922+0638 (B0919+06) shows unexplained anomalous variations in the on-pulse phase, where the pulse appears to episodically move to an earlier longitude for a few tens of rotations before reverting to the usual phase for approximately several hundred to more than a thousand rotations. These events, where the pulse moves in phase by up to 5°, have been previously detected in observations from ∼300 to 2000 MHz. We present simultaneous observations from the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at 1350 MHz and the Bornim (Potsdam) station of the LOw Frequency ARray at 150 MHz. Our observations present the first evidence for an absence of the anomalous phase-shifting behaviour at 150 MHz. Instead, the observed intensity at the usual pulse-phase typically decreases, often showing a pseudo-nulling feature corresponding to the times when phase shifts are observed at 1350 MHz. The presence of weak emission at the usual pulse-phase supports the theory that these shifts may result from processes similar to the `profile-absorption' expected to operate for PSR J0814+7429 (B0809+74). A possible mechanism for this could be intrinsic variations of the emission within the pulsar's beam combined with absorption by expanding shells of electrons in the line of sight."

abstract: "We search for continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) produced by individual supermassive black hole binaries in circular orbits using high-cadence timing observations of PSR J1713+0747. We observe this millisecond pulsar using the telescopes in the European Pulsar Timing Array with an average cadence of approximately 1.6 d over the period between 2011 April and 2015 July, including an approximately daily average between 2013 February and 2014 April. The high-cadence observations are used to improve the pulsar timing sensitivity across the gravitational wave frequency range of 0.008-5μHz. We use two algorithms in the analysis, including a spectral fitting method and a Bayesian approach. For an independent comparison, we also use a previously published Bayesian algorithm. We find that the Bayesian approaches provide optimal results and the timing observations of the pulsar place a 95 per cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude of CGWs to be ≲3.5 × 10<SUP>-13</SUP> at a reference frequency of 1 μHz. We also find a 95 per cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude of low-frequency CGWs to be ≲1.4 × 10<SUP>-14</SUP> at a reference frequency of 20 nHz."

abstract: "Pulsar-timing analyses are sensitive to errors in the Solar-system ephemerides (SSEs) that timing models utilize to estimate the location of the Solar-system barycentre, the quasi-inertial reference frame to which all recorded pulse times-of-arrival are referred. Any error in the SSE will affect all pulsars, therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a suitable tool to search for such errors and impose independent constraints on relevant physical parameters. We employ the first data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array to constrain the masses of the planet-moons systems and to search for possible unmodelled objects (UMOs) in the Solar system. We employ 10 SSEs from two independent research groups, derive and compare mass constraints of planetary systems, and derive the first PTA mass constraints on asteroid-belt objects. Constraints on planetary-system masses have been improved by factors of up to 20 from the previous relevant study using the same assumptions, with the mass of the Jovian system measured at 9.5479189(3) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the dwarf planet Ceres is measured at 4.7(4) × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also present the first sensitivity curves using real data that place generic limits on the masses of UMOs, which can also be used as upper limits on the mass of putative exotic objects. For example, upper limits on dark-matter clumps are comparable to published limits using independent methods. While the constraints on planetary masses derived with all employed SSEs are consistent, we note and discuss differences in the associated timing residuals and UMO sensitivity curves."

abstract: "Symmetries play a fundamental role in modern theories of gravity. The strong equivalence principle (SEP) constitutes a collection of gravitational symmetries which are all implemented by general relativity. Alternative theories, however, are generally expected to violate some aspects of SEP. We test three aspects of SEP using observed change rates in the orbital period and eccentricity of binary pulsar J1713+0747: (1) the gravitational constant's constancy as part of locational invariance of gravitation; (2) the universality of free fall (UFF) for strongly self-gravitating bodies; (3) the post-Newtonian parameter \hat{α }_3 in gravitational Lorentz invariance. Based on the pulsar timing result of the combined data set from the North American Nanohertz Gravitational Observatory and the European Pulsar Timing Array, we find \dot{G}/G = (-0.1 ± 0.9) × 10^{-12} yr^{-1}, which is weaker than Solar system limits, but applies for strongly self-gravitating objects. Furthermore, we obtain an improved test for a UFF violation by a strongly self-gravitating mass falling in the gravitational field of our Galaxy, with a limit of |Δ| &lt; 0.002 (95 per cent C.L.). Finally, we derive an improved limit on the self-acceleration of a gravitationally bound rotating body, to a preferred reference frame in the Universe, with -3× 10^{-20} &lt; \hat{α }_3 &lt; 4× 10^{-20} (95 per cent C.L.). These results are based on direct UFF and \hat{α }_3 tests using pulsar binaries, and they overcome various limitations of previous tests of this kind."

These results are based on direct UFF and \hat{α }_3 tests using pulsar binaries, and they overcome various limitations of previous tests of this kind."

abstract: "Dispersive delays due to the solar wind introduce excess noise in high-precision pulsar timing experiments, and must be removed in order to achieve the accuracy needed to detect, e.g., low-frequency gravitational waves. In current pulsar timing experiments, this delay is usually removed by approximating the electron density distribution in the solar wind either as spherically symmetric or with a two-phase model that describes the contributions from both high- and low-speed phases of the solar wind. However, no data set has previously been available to test the performance and limitations of these models over extended time-scales and with sufficient sensitivity. Here we present the results of such a test with an optimal data set of observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations of LOFAR. We conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better than the two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a rms given by the two-phase model being up to 28 per cent larger than the result obtained with the spherical approximation. Never the less, the spherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the solar wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the Sun), as it leaves timing residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent of 0.3 μs at 1400 MHz. This is because a spherical model ignores the large daily variations in electron density observed in the solar wind. In the short term, broad-band observations or simultaneous observations at low frequencies are the most promising way forward to correct for solar-wind-induced delay variations."

abstract: "In this paper, we describe the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release, which includes recent pulsar timing data obtained by three regional consortia: the European Pulsar Timing Array, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, and the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We analyse and where possible combine high-precision timing data for 65 millisecond pulsars which are regularly observed by these groups. A basic noise analysis, including the processes which are both correlated and uncorrelated in time, provides noise models and timing ephemerides for the pulsars. We find that the timing precisions of pulsars are generally improved compared to the previous data release, mainly due to the addition of new data in the combination. The main purpose of this work is to create the most up-to-date IPTA data release. These data are publicly available for searches for low-frequency gravitational waves and other pulsar science."

abstract: "We have constructed a new time-scale, TT(IPTA16), based on observations of radio pulsars presented in the first data release from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise models for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar time-scale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected time-scale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based time-scales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best time-scales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic time-scales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based time-scale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves."

abstract: "We study the timing stability of three black widow pulsars (BWPs), both in terms of their long-term spin evolution and their shorter term orbital stability. The erratic timing behaviour and radio eclipses of the first two BWP systems discovered (PSRs B1957+20 and J2051-0827) were assumed to be representative for this class of pulsars. With several new black widow systems added to this population in the last decade, there are now several systems known that do not show these typical orbital variations or radio eclipses. We present timing solutions using 7-8 yr of observations from four of the European Pulsar Timing Array telescopes for PSRs J0023+0923, J2214+3000, and J2234+0944, and confirm that two of these systems do not show any significant orbital variability over our observing time span, both in terms of secular or orbital parameters. The third pulsar PSR J0023+0923 shows orbital variability and we discuss the implications for the timing solution. Our results from the long-term timing of these pulsars provide several new or improved parameters compared to earlier works. We discuss our results regarding the stability of these pulsars, and the stability of the class of BWPs in general, in the context of the binary parameters, and discuss the potential of the Roche lobe filling factor of the companion star being an indicator for stability of these systems."

abstract: "We describe system verification tests and early science results from the pulsar processor (PTUSE) developed for the newly commissioned 64-dish SARAO MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. MeerKAT is a high-gain ( ${∼}2.8 \mbox{K Jy}^{-1}$ ) low-system temperature ( ${∼}18 \mbox{K at }20 \mbox{cm}$ ) radio array that currently operates at 580-1 670 MHz and can produce tied-array beams suitable for pulsar observations. This paper presents results from the MeerTime Large Survey Project and commissioning tests with PTUSE. Highlights include observations of the double pulsar $\mbox{J}0737{-}3039\mbox{A}$ , pulse profiles from 34 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from a single 2.5-h observation of the Globular cluster Terzan 5, the rotation measure of Ter5O, a 420-sigma giant pulse from the Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR $\mbox{J}0540{-}6919$ , and nulling identified in the slow pulsar PSR J0633-2015. One of the key design specifications for MeerKAT was absolute timing errors of less than 5 ns using their novel precise time system. Our timing of two bright MSPs confirm that MeerKAT delivers exceptional timing. PSR $\mbox{J}2241{-}5236$ exhibits a jitter limit of $&lt;4 \mbox{ns h}^{-1}$ whilst timing of PSR $\mbox{J}1909{-}3744$ over almost 11 months yields an rms residual of 66 ns with only 4 min integrations. Our results confirm that the MeerKAT is an exceptional pulsar telescope. The array can be split into four separate sub-arrays to time over 1 000 pulsars per day and the future deployment of S-band (1 750-3 500 MHz) receivers will further enhance its capabilities."

abstract: "Context. High-precision pulsar timing requires accurate corrections for dispersive delays of radio waves, parametrized by the dispersion measure (DM), particularly if these delays are variable in time. In a previous paper, we studied the solar wind (SW) models used in pulsar timing to mitigate the excess of DM that is annually induced by the SW and found these to be insufficient for high-precision pulsar timing. Here we analyze additional pulsar datasets to further investigate which aspects of the SW models currently used in pulsar timing can be readily improved, and at what levels of timing precision SW mitigation is possible. <BR /> Aims: Our goals are to verify: (a) whether the data are better described by a spherical model of the SW with a time-variable amplitude, rather than a time-invariant one as suggested in literature, and (b) whether a temporal trend of such a model's amplitudes can be detected. <BR /> Methods: We use the pulsar timing technique on low-frequency pulsar observations to estimate the DM and quantify how this value changes as the Earth moves around the Sun. Specifically, we monitor the DM in weekly to monthly observations of 14 pulsars taken with parts of the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) across time spans of up to 6 years. We develop an informed algorithm to separate the interstellar variations in the DM from those caused by the SW and demonstrate the functionality of this algorithm with extensive simulations. Assuming a spherically symmetric model for the SW density, we derive the amplitude of this model for each year of observations. <BR /> Results: We show that a spherical model with a time-variable amplitude models the observations better than a spherical model with a constant amplitude, but that both approaches leave significant SW-induced delays uncorrected in a number of pulsars in the sample. The amplitude of the spherical model is found to be variable in time, as opposed to what has been previously suggested."

abstract: "Context. NenuFAR (New extension in Nançay upgrading LOFAR) is a new radio telescope developed and built on the site of the Nançay Radio Observatory. It is designed to observe the largely unexplored frequency window from 10 to 85 MHz, offering a high sensitivity across its full bandwidth. NenuFAR has started its "early science" operation in July 2019, with 58% of its final collecting area. <BR /> Aims: Pulsars are one of the major phenomena utilized in the scientific exploitation of this frequency range and represent an important challenge in terms of instrumentation. Designing instrumentation at these frequencies is complicated by the need to compensate for the effects of both the interstellar medium and the ionosphere on the observed signal. We have designed a dedicated backend and developed a complete pulsar observation and data analysis pipeline, which we describe in detail in the present paper, together with first science results illustrating the diversity of the pulsar observing modes. <BR /> Methods: Our real-time pipeline LUPPI (Low frequency Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrumentation) is able to cope with a high data rate and provide real-time coherent de-dispersion down to the lowest frequencies reached by NenuFAR (10 MHz). The full backend functionality is described, as the available pulsar observing modes (folded, single-pulse, waveform, and dynamic spectrum). <BR /> Results: We also present some of the early science results of NenuFAR on pulsars: the detection of 12 millisecond pulsars (eight of which are detected for the first time below 100 MHz); a high-frequency resolution mapping of the PSR B1919+21 emission profile and a detailed observation of single-pulse substructures from PSR B0809+74 down to 16 MHz; the high rate of giant-pulse emission from the Crab pulsar detected at 68.7 MHz (43 events per minute); and the illustration of the very good timing performance of the instrumentation, which allows us to study dispersion measure variations in great detail."

abstract: "We report on an unusually bright observation of PSR J2051 - 0827 recorded during a regular monitoring campaign of black-widow pulsar systems with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. Through fortunate coincidence, a particularly bright scintillation maximum is simultaneous with the eclipse by the companion, enabling precise measurements of variations in the flux density, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering strength throughout the eclipse. The flux density is highly variable throughout the eclipse, with a peak 1.7 times the average away from the eclipse, and yet does not significantly decrease on average. We recover the flux density variations from the measured DM variations using geometric optics, with a relative velocity as the only free parameter. We measure an effective velocity of 470 ± 10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with the relative orbital motion of the companion, suggesting that the outflow velocity of the lensing material is low, or is directly along the line of sight. The $2{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ uncertainty on the effective velocity is a formal error; systematics related to our current model are likely to dominate, and we detail several extensions to the model to be considered in a full treatment of lensing. This is a demonstration of the causal link between DM and lensing; the flux density variations can be predicted directly through the derivatives of DM. Going forward, this approach can be applied to investigate the dynamics of other eclipsing systems, and to investigate the physical nature of scintillation and lensing in the ionized interstellar medium."

abstract: "We present results from the search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) as predicted by the theory of General Relativity using six radio millisecond pulsars from the Data Release 2 (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) covering a timespan up to 24 yr. A GWB manifests itself as a long-term low-frequency stochastic signal common to all pulsars, a common red signal (CRS), with the characteristic Hellings-Downs (HD) spatial correlation. Our analysis is performed with two independent pipelines, ENTERPRISE, and TEMPONEST+FORTYTWO, which produce consistent results. A search for a CRS with simultaneous estimation of its spatial correlations yields spectral properties compatible with theoretical GWB predictions, but does not result in the required measurement of the HD correlation, as required for GWB detection. Further Bayesian model comparison between different types of CRSs, including a GWB, finds the most favoured model to be the common uncorrelated red noise described by a power law with $A = 5.13_{-2.73}^{+4.20} \times 10^{-15}$ and $\gamma = 3.78_{-0.59}^{+0.69}$ (95 per cent credible regions). Fixing the spectral index to γ = 13/3 as expected from the GWB by circular, inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries results in an amplitude of $A =2.95_{-0.72}^{+0.89} \times 10^{-15}$. We implement three different models, BAYESEPHEM, LINIMOSS, and EPHEMGP, to address possible Solar system ephemeris (SSE) systematics and conclude that our results may only marginally depend on these effects. This work builds on the methods and models from the studies on the EPTA DR1. We show that under the same analysis framework the results remain consistent after the data set extension."

abstract: "PSR B0950+08 is a bright nonrecycled pulsar whose single-pulse fluence variability is reportedly large. Based on observations at two widely separated frequencies, 55 MHz (NenuFAR) and 1.4 GHz (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope), we review the properties of these single pulses. We conclude that they are more similar to ordinary pulses of radio emission than to a special kind of short and bright giant pulses, observed from only a handful of pulsars. We argue that a temporal variation of the properties of the interstellar medium along the line of sight to this nearby pulsar, namely the fluctuating size of the decorrelation bandwidth of diffractive scintillation makes an important contribution to the observed single-pulse fluence variability. We further present interesting structures in the low-frequency single-pulse spectra that resemble the "sad trombones" seen in fast radio bursts (FRBs); although for PSR B0950+08 the upward frequency drift is also routinely present. We explain these spectral features with radius-to-frequency mapping, similar to the model developed by Wang et al. (2019, ApJ, 876, L15) for FRBs. Finally, we speculate that μs-scale fluence variability of the general pulsar population remains poorly known, and that its further study may bring important clues about the nature of FRBs."

abstract: "Context. Extracting precise pulse times of arrival (TOAs) and their uncertainties is the first and most fundamental step in high-precision pulsar timing. In the classical method, TOAs are derived from total intensity pulse profiles of pulsars via cross-correlation with an idealised 1D template of that profile. While a number of results have been presented in the literature that rely on the ever increasing sensitivity of these pulsar timing experiments, there is no consensus on the most reliable methods for creating TOAs, and, more importantly, on the associated TOA uncertainties for each scheme. <BR /> Aims: We present a comprehensive comparison of TOA determination practices. We focus on creating timing templates, TOA determination methods, and the most useful TOA bandwidth. The aim is to present a possible approach towards TOA optimisation, the (partial) identification of an optimal TOA-creation scheme, and the demonstration of optimisation differences between pulsars and data sets. <BR /> Methods: We compared the values of data-derived template profiles with analytic profiles and evaluated the three most commonly used template-matching methods. Finally, we studied the relation between timing precision and TOA bandwidth to identify any potential breaks in this relation. As a practical demonstration, we applied our selected methods to European Pulsar Timing Array data on three test pulsars, PSRs J0218+4232, J1713+0747, and J2145−0750. <BR /> Results: Our demonstration shows that data-derived and smoothed templates are typically preferred to some more commonly applied alternatives. The template-matching method called Fourier domain with Markov chain Monte Carlo is generally superior to or competitive with other methods. While the optimal TOA bandwidth is strongly dependent on pulsar brightness, telescope sensitivity, and scintillation properties, some significant frequency averaging seems required for the data we investigated."

abstract: "Context. Interstellar scintillation analysis of pulsars allows us to probe the small-scale distribution and inhomogeneities of the ionized interstellar medium. From the frequency scale of scintillation, one can estimate the geometric time delays from multipath propagation, a source of (typically) unmodeled, correlated noise in pulsar timing.

We found some interesting features which will be studied in more detail in subsequent papers in this series: (i) in the time series of PSR J1939+2134, where v<SUB>d</SUB> and τ<SUB>d</SUB> sharply decrease associated with a sharp increase in the dispersion measure; (ii) PSR J0613-0200 and PSR J0636+5126 show a strong annual variation in the time series of the τ<SUB>d</SUB>; and (iii) PSR J1939+2134 shows a weak anticorrelation between the scintillation timescale and the dispersion in Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope data."

abstract: "The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration has recently released an extended data set for six pulsars (DR2) and reported evidence for a common red noise signal. Here we present a noise analysis for each of the six pulsars. We consider several types of noise: (i) radio frequency independent, 'achromatic', and time-correlated red noise; (ii) variations of dispersion measure and scattering; (iii) system and band noise; and (iv) deterministic signals (other than gravitational waves) that could be present in the PTA data. We perform Bayesian model selection to find the optimal combination of noise components for each pulsar. Using these custom models we revisit the presence of the common uncorrelated red noise signal previously reported in the EPTA DR2 and show that the data still supports it with a high statistical significance. Next, we confirm that there is no preference for or against the Hellings-Downs spatial correlations expected for the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The main conclusion of the EPTA DR2 paper remains unchanged despite a very significant change in the noise model of each pulsar. However, modelling the noise is essential for the robust detection of gravitational waves and its impact could be significant when analysing the next EPTA data release, which will include a larger number of pulsars and more precise measurements."

Inproceedings


European Pulsar Timing Array - Data Release 2.0


Shaifullah, Golam


2022


31st Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics


129


Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are inching closer to the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), most likely produced through the inspiral of nearly circularised SMBHBs. In the coming months the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) will be releasing its latest dataset, adding approximately ten years of high precision pulsar timing data to bring the total timespan up to almost 25 years. This new dataset contains almost twice the previous data volume, and is leading to significantly increased (pulsar timing) precision. A small part of this new dataset has already been used to place the EPTA's current limit on the amplitude of the stochastic GWB as well as showing the presence of a common but spatially uncorrelated red noise process, and the full dataset will be used to significantly improve the current results at both, lower and higher frequencies, as well as investigating a number of other PTA scientific objectives. I will present the current state of the dataset, our release plans and early science insights.

abstract: "Pulsar timing arrays offer a probe of the low-frequency gravitational wave spectrum (1-100 nHz), which is intimately connected to a number of markers that can uniquely trace the formation and evolution of the Universe. We present the dataset and the results of the timing analysis from the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). The dataset contains high-precision pulsar timing data from 25 millisecond pulsars collected with the five largest radio telescopes in Europe, as well as the Large European Array for Pulsars. The dataset forms the foundation for the search for gravitational waves by the EPTA, presented in associated papers. We describe the dataset and present the results of the frequentist and Bayesian pulsar timing analysis for individual millisecond pulsars that have been observed over the last ~25 yr. We discuss the improvements to the individual pulsar parameter estimates, as well as new measurements of the physical properties of these pulsars and their companions. This data release extends the dataset from EPTA Data Release 1 up to the beginning of 2021, with individual pulsar datasets with timespans ranging from 14 to 25 yr. These lead to improved constraints on annual parallaxes, secular variation of the orbital period, and Shapiro delay for a number of sources. Based on these results, we derived astrophysical parameters that include distances, transverse velocities, binary pulsar masses, and annual orbital parallaxes."

abstract: "<BR /> Aims: The nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) is expected to be an aggregate signal of an ensemble of gravitational waves emitted predominantly by a large population of coalescing supermassive black hole binaries in the centres of merging galaxies. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), which are ensembles of extremely stable pulsars at approximately kiloparsec distances precisely monitored for decades, are the most precise experiments capable of detecting this background. However, the subtle imprints that the GWB induces on pulsar timing data are obscured by many sources of noise that occur on various timescales. These must be carefully modelled and mitigated to increase the sensitivity to the background signal. <BR /> Methods: In this paper, we present a novel technique to estimate the optimal number of frequency coefficients for modelling achromatic and chromatic noise, while selecting the preferred set of noise models to use for each pulsar. We also incorporated a new model to fit for scattering variations in the Bayesian pulsar timing package temponest.

abstract: "We present the results of the search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies using the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) for 25 millisecond pulsars and a combination with the first data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA). A robust GWB detection is conditioned upon resolving the Hellings-Downs angular pattern in the pairwise cross-correlation of the pulsar timing residuals. Additionally, the GWB is expected to yield the same (common) spectrum of temporal correlations across pulsars, which is used as a null hypothesis in the GWB search. Such a common-spectrum process has already been observed in pulsar timing data. We analysed (i) the full 24.7-year EPTA data set, (ii) its 10.3-year subset based on modern observing systems, (iii) the combination of the full data set with the first data release of the InPTA for ten commonly timed millisecond pulsars, and (iv) the combination of the 10.3-year subset with the InPTA data. These combinations allowed us to probe the contributions of instrumental noise and interstellar propagation effects. With the full data set, we find marginal evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of four and a false alarm probability of 4%. With the 10.3-year subset, we report evidence for a GWB, with a Bayes factor of 60 and a false alarm probability of about 0.1% (≳3σ significance). The addition of the InPTA data yields results that are broadly consistent with the EPTA-only data sets, with the benefit of better noise modelling. Analyses were performed with different data processing pipelines to test the consistency of the results from independent software packages. The latest EPTA data from new generation observing systems show non-negligible evidence for the GWB. At the same time, the inferred spectrum is rather uncertain and in mild tension with the common signal measured in the full data set. However, if the spectral index is fixed at 13/3, the two data sets give a similar amplitude of (2.5 ± 0.7) × 10<SUP>−15</SUP> at a reference frequency of 1 yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. Further investigation of these issues is required for reliable astrophysical interpretations of this signal. By continuing our detection efforts as part of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), we expect to be able to improve the measurement of spatial correlations and better characterise this signal in the coming years."

abstract: "Solar-wind 3-D reconstruction tomography based on interplanetary scintillation (IPS) studies provides fundamental information for space-weather forecasting models, and gives the possibility to determine heliospheric column densities. Here we compare the time series of Solar-wind column densities derived from long-term observations of pulsars, and the Solar-wind reconstruction provided by the UCSD IPS tomography. In particular, we analyze the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Solar passages of PSR J0034-0534, and the 2016 and 2018 Solar passages of PSR J1022 + 1001. The results show that, where the UCSD IPS tomography makes use of its most robust settings, the matches between the two techniques are characterized by Pearson's R coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.90, indicating a good level of agreement. This unique work represents a completely independent comparison and validation of these techniques to provide such measurements, and it strengthens confidence in the use of both in space-weather analyses applications."

abstract: "In space weather studies and forecasting we employ magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which can provide rather accurate reconstruction of the solar wind dynamics and its evolution. However, all MHD simulations are restricted by the input data and the modelled solar wind characteristics need to be validated with different types of observations. That is very difficult, in particular for the solar wind characteristics close to the Sun, since the majority of in situ observations are taken in the vicinity of the Earth. This is why all alternative methods for estimation of solar wind plasma characteristics are very important. In this study we utilise low radio frequency observations of pulsars to probe the total electron content along the line of sight. For the first time, we compare density estimates from pulsars with predictions from the 3D MHD modelling code; the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). We find a very good correlation for the solar wind density along a given line of sight obtained by EUHFORIA and pulsar observations. We demonstrate that pulsar observations can be very useful not only for the model validation but also for understanding its limitations."

abstract: "Interstellar scattering (ISS) of radio pulsar emission can be used as a probe of the ionized interstellar medium (IISM) and causes corruptions in pulsar timing experiments. Two types of ISS phenomena (intensity scintillation and pulse broadening) are caused by electron density fluctuations on small scales (&lt; 0.01 au). Theory predicts that these are related, and both have been widely employed to study the properties of the IISM. Larger scales (~1 - 100 au) cause measurable changes in dispersion and these can be correlated with ISS observations to estimate the fluctuation spectrum over a very wide scale range. IISM measurements can often be modelled by a homogeneous power-law spatial spectrum of electron density with the Kolmogorov (-11/3) spectral exponent. Here, we aim to test the validity of using the Kolmogorov exponent with PSR J0826+2637. We do so using observations of intensity scintillation, pulse broadening and dispersion variations across a wide fractional bandwidth (20-180 MHz). We present that the frequency dependence of the intensity scintillation in the high-frequency band matches the expectations of a Kolmogorov spectral exponent, but the pulse broadening in the low-frequency band does not change as rapidly as predicted with this assumption. We show that this behaviour is due to an inhomogeneity in the scattering region, specifically that the scattering is dominated by a region of transverse size ~40 au. The power spectrum of the electron density, however, maintains the Kolmogorov spectral exponent from spatial scales of 5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> au to ~100 au."

Theory predicts that these are related, and both have been widely employed to study the properties of the IISM. Larger scales (~1 - 100 au) cause measurable changes in dispersion and these can be correlated with ISS observations to estimate the fluctuation spectrum over a very wide scale range. IISM measurements can often be modelled by a homogeneous power-law spatial spectrum of electron density with the Kolmogorov (-11/3) spectral exponent. Here, we aim to test the validity of using the Kolmogorov exponent with PSR J0826+2637. We do so using observations of intensity scintillation, pulse broadening and dispersion variations across a wide fractional bandwidth (20-180 MHz). We present that the frequency dependence of the intensity scintillation in the high-frequency band matches the expectations of a Kolmogorov spectral exponent, but the pulse broadening in the low-frequency band does not change as rapidly as predicted with this assumption. We show that this behaviour is due to an inhomogeneity in the scattering region, specifically that the scattering is dominated by a region of transverse size ~40 au. The power spectrum of the electron density, however, maintains the Kolmogorov spectral exponent from spatial scales of 5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> au to ~100 au."

abstract: "The International Pulsar Timing Array 2nd data release is the combination of data sets from worldwide collaborations. In this study, we search for continuous waves: gravitational wave signals produced by individual supermassive black hole binaries in the local universe. We consider binaries on circular orbits and neglect the evolution of orbital frequency over the observational span. We find no evidence for such signals and set sky averaged 95 per cent upper limits on their amplitude h<SUB>95</SUB>. The most sensitive frequency is 10 nHz with h<SUB>95</SUB> = 9.1 × 10<SUP>-15</SUP>. We achieved the best upper limit to date at low and high frequencies of the PTA band thanks to improved effective cadence of observations. In our analysis, we have taken into account the recently discovered common red noise process, which has an impact at low frequencies. We also find that the peculiar noise features present in some pulsars data must be taken into account to reduce the false alarm. We show that using custom noise models is essential in searching for continuous gravitational wave signals and setting the upper limit."

abstract: "The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaboration has recently made its first official data release (DR1) for a sample of 14 pulsars using 3.5 years of uGMRT observations. We present the results of single-pulsar noise analysis for each of these 14 pulsars using the InPTA DR1. For this purpose, we consider white noise, achromatic red noise, dispersion measure (DM) variations, and scattering variations in our analysis. We apply Bayesian model selection to obtain the preferred noise models among these for each pulsar. For PSR J 1600 −3053 , we find no evidence of DM and scattering variations, while for PSR J 1909 −3744 , we find no significant scattering variations. Properties vary dramatically among pulsars. For example, we find a strong chromatic noise with chromatic index ∼2.9 for PSR J 1939 +2134 , indicating the possibility of a scattering index that does not agree with that expected for a Kolmogorov scattering medium consistent with similar results for millisecond pulsars in past studies. Despite the relatively short time baseline, the noise models broadly agree with the other PTAs and provide, at the same time, well-constrained DM and scattering variations."

abstract: "We search for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a network of cosmic strings using six millisecond pulsars from Data Release 2 (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). We perform a Bayesian analysis considering two models for the network of cosmic string loops, and compare it to a simple power-law model which is expected from the population of supermassive black hole binaries. Our main strong assumption is that the previously reported common red noise process is a SGWB. We find that the one-parameter cosmic string model is slightly favored over a power-law model thanks to its simplicity. If we assume a two-component stochastic signal in the data (supermassive black hole binary population and the signal from cosmic strings), we get a 95% upper limit on the string tension of log<SUB>10</SUB>(G μ )&lt;-9.9 (-10.5 ) for the two cosmic string models we consider. In extended two-parameter string models, we were unable to constrain the number of kinks. We test two approximate and fast Bayesian data analysis methods against the most rigorous analysis and find consistent results. These two fast and efficient methods are applicable to all SGWBs, independent of their source, and will be crucial for analysis of extended datasets."

abstract: "Ice and snow meltwater are important components of the glacier-fed Himalayan rivers that control the seasonal streamflow pattern. With the ongoing global warming, there remains significant uncertainty regarding how melting Himalayan glaciers will impact the water runoff. Here, we quantified the rainwater, ice meltwater, snow meltwater, and groundwater flow in the river using a δ<SUP>18</SUP>O, d, and Cl<SUP>-</SUP> -based 4-component hydro-geochemical mixing model. At a weekly resolution, we measured the stable water isotopes (<SUP>18</SUP>O/<SUP>16</SUP>O and <SUP>2</SUP>H/<SUP>1</SUP>H, expressed as δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and δD), Cl<SUP>-</SUP> and Na<SUP>+</SUP> near the river Alaknanda mouth, in the Upper Ganga Basin over one year (2018-2019). The weekly scale time-series geochemical record captured the subtle variability of ice and snow meltwater flow in the Alaknanda River. The two most significant observation was (i) an onset of snow meltwater was observed as early as in March during the study period contrary to our present understanding that the onset of snow meltwater usually happens in April, and (ii) a significant increase in ice and snow meltwater flow during the peak monsoon season. The early onset of snow meltwater runoff in the Himalayan rivers could be an important concern as this could potentially reduce the flow of snow meltwater during the early summer months when water demand is highest due to intense agricultural activities in the mountainous region. Similarly, an increase in ice meltwater runoff in the monsoon season increases the risks of major flood events. Since weekly scale time-series data of ice meltwater, snow meltwater, rainwater, and groundwater flow in glacier-fed Himalayan rivers over the entire hydrological year was largely missing, this study provides an important dataset to better understand the year-long dependency of the Himalayan rivers on the glaciers critical to improving the accuracy and predictive power of hydrologic models."
