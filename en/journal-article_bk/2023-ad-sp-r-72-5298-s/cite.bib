 abstract = {In space weather studies and forecasting we employ magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which can provide rather accurate reconstruction of the solar wind dynamics and its evolution. However, all MHD simulations are restricted by the input data and the modelled solar wind characteristics need to be validated with different types of observations. That is very difficult, in particular for the solar wind characteristics close to the Sun, since the majority of in situ observations are taken in the vicinity of the Earth. This is why all alternative methods for estimation of solar wind plasma characteristics are very important. In this study we utilise low radio frequency observations of pulsars to probe the total electron content along the line of sight. For the first time, we compare density estimates from pulsars with predictions from the 3D MHD modelling code; the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). We find a very good correlation for the solar wind density along a given line of sight obtained by EUHFORIA and pulsar observations. We demonstrate that pulsar observations can be very useful not only for the model validation but also for understanding its limitations.},
