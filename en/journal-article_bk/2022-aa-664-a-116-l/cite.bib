 abstract = {Context. Interstellar scintillation analysis of pulsars allows us to probe the small-scale distribution and inhomogeneities of the ionized interstellar medium. From the frequency scale of scintillation, one can estimate the geometric time delays from multipath propagation, a source of (typically) unmodeled, correlated noise in pulsar timing. Interstellar scintillation analysis of well-timed pulsars is useful to quantify the effects of time delays and may lead to improved timing precision, enhancing the probability of detecting gravitational waves. <BR /> Aims: Our priority is to present the data set and the basic measurements of scintillation parameters of pulsars, employing long-term scintillation observations carried out from 2011 January to 2020 August by the European Pulsar Timing Array radio telescopes in the 21-cm and 11-cm bands. Additionally, we aim to identify future possible lines of study using this long-term scintillation data set. <BR /> Methods: The autocorrelation function of dynamic spectra has been used to estimate the scintillation bandwidth v<SUB>d</SUB> and scintillation timescale τ<SUB>d</SUB>. <BR /> Results: We present the long-term time series of v<SUB>d</SUB> and τ<SUB>d</SUB> for 13 pulsars. Sanity checks and comparisons indicate that the scintillation parameters of our work and previously published works are mostly consistent. For two pulsars, PSRs J1857+0943 and J1939+2134, we were able to obtain measurements of the v<SUB>d</SUB> at both bands, which allowed us to derive the time series of frequency scaling indices with a mean and a standard deviation of 2.82 ± 1.95 and 3.18 ± 0.60, respectively. We found some interesting features which will be studied in more detail in subsequent papers in this series: (i) in the time series of PSR J1939+2134, where v<SUB>d</SUB> and τ<SUB>d</SUB> sharply decrease associated with a sharp increase in the dispersion measure; (ii) PSR J0613-0200 and PSR J0636+5126 show a strong annual variation in the time series of the τ<SUB>d</SUB>; and (iii) PSR J1939+2134 shows a weak anticorrelation between the scintillation timescale and the dispersion in Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope data.},
