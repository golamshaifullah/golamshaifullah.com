	abstract = {State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves &lpar;GWs&rpar; in pulsar timing array &lpar;PTA&rpar; datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries &lpar;SMBHBs&rpar;, which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. In this talk, I will present a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, which characterise the GW signals using a simple power law model, in realistic datasets. The investigated datasets consist of synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA &lpar;EPTA&rpar; second data release &lpar;DR2&rpar;. The datasets include uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. The injected timing residuals are computed in two different ways: from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs. Performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal, I will show that current search models efficiently recover the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch. Moreover, I will present some interesting examples of simulated PTA datasets where the GW signal is computed from realistic SMBHB populations, and show how their specific features are reflected in the outcome of the analysis.},
