	abstract = {Highly precise monitoring of arrival times of pulses from pulsars will allow for gravitational-wave detection in the nano-Hertz regime in the near future. Due to the complex nature of such pulsar-timing experiments and to the large number of effects that can affect these data &lpar;starting with magnetospheric effects at the pulsars themselves but extending across the entire signal path down to the final gravitational-wave detection algorithm&rpar;, any treatment of the measurement uncertainties relevant to such a gravitational-wave detection has been lacking and incomplete so far. <P />In this review, we provide an exhaustive description of the currently known influences on measurement precision in pulsar-timing experiments in general and in gravitational-wave detection through pulsar-timing specifically. While some of these effects remain poorly understood and largely unquantified at present, we discuss both analytic and observational quantifications where available.},
