	abstract = {State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves &lpar;GWs&rpar; in pulsar timing array &lpar;PTA&rpar; datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian, and stationary process described by a power law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries &lpar;SMBHBs&rpar;. This stochastic signal is usually referred to as the GW background &lpar;GWB&rpar; and is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We performed a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power-law model to characterise GW signals in realistic datasets. We used, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA &lpar;EPTA&rpar; second data release &lpar;DR2&rpar;. Thus, we included in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise, and multi-frequency observations. We then injected timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We found that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identified via probability-probability &lpar;P-P&rpar; plots and quantified using Kolmogorov-Smirnov &lpar;KS&rpar; statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with a SMBHB origin.},
